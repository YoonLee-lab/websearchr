## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the Title from "Access Domains and Search Popular Websites Directly from the R Console" to "Access Domains and Search Popular Websites", as suggested.

* Also changed the Description from "Functions that allow for accessing domains and a number of search engines directly from the R Console." to "Functions that allow for accessing domains and a number of search engines."

## Test environments
* local OS X install (Sierra), R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There was 1 NOTE on win-builder: 

"checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Florian Simon Schaffner <schaffner.florian@gmail.com>'"

* This is the first package submission.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
