# websearchr

The goal of **websearchr** is to provide a convenient way of accessing domains and searching popular websites directly from the R console. When working on small screens in particular, switching from the R console to the browser window, opening a new tab, navigating to the desired website and finally searching for the search terms requires around 3-6 clicks. As one is working mainly in the R console, it is more convenient to start typing the search terms right away, without having to go through the process mentioned above. For example, `stackoverflow("my r problem")` will open the Stackoverflow search for "my r problem" in a new browser tab automatically.

Currently supported websites:

* Bing
* Crossref
* Duckduckgo
* GitHub
* Google
* Google Scholar
* Qwant
* r-bloggers.com
* Rdocumentation.org
* rdrr.io
* Reddit
* Stackoverflow
* Twitter
* Wikipedia
* Wolfram Alpha

Any other domain can be accessed with `web("example.com")`. 

#### Language support

Twitter and Wikipedia can be searched in different languages than English. For example, to search the French version of Wikipedia use `wikipedia("Langage de programmation", "fr")`. 

#### Browser

To use a browser other than the default on your computer use `options(browser = "path to browser")`. For example, on macOS `options(browser = "/usr/bin/open -a '/Applications/Safari.app'")` or Windows `options(browser = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe")`. To check which browser is set as the default use `getOption("browser")`.
